# turboamper

turboamper is a simple library that makes easy to create AMP representation for some social network embed materials.
It is planned to support Facebook, Vkontakte, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and some custom iframes.

## Download and install

As usual, ```go get github.com/RGRU/turboamper```

Turboamper supports modules since it was written with go-1.13, so you can add the package to your go.mod file:

```require github.com/RGRU/turboamper version```
